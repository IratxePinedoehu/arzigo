# arzigo
 A recommendation system for scientific articles
Arzigo is a web-based Recommender System for scientific articles, which feeds on the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus.  Based on data implicitly collected from the user, ArZiGo is a hybrid system that combines Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering techniques to recommend  those  papers  that  best  suit  the  user  preferences.

The evaluation of ArZiGo has required the development of a synthetic data generator capable of generating the interactions of the users with the research papers of their interes. The following diagram shows the algorithm that follows the data generator:

The dataset generated for the evaluation of the proposed system is now availeable for the research community.
